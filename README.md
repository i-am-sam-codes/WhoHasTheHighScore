# WhoHasTheHighScore
This is one of my first C# console apps. 
In the code below we see a program that lets the user create 
a username and a password the program reads it and asks for the 
input again that goes through and if else statement that checks if 
the conditions are true and throws a response depending if the username 
and password is correct or if it failed.
